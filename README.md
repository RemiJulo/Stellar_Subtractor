## > First use

1. Modify `param.py`

    [x] Assign `input_paths` a sub-list of paths to .fits files (or to folders full of .fits files) to be processed  
    [x] Make sure that `save_verbose`, `print_verbose` and `show_verbose` are assigned to `1` to monitor execution  
    [x] Choose the folder names of the backup path `saving_folders` in which all results will be saved

2. Execute `main.py`

    [x] Either open a terminal and type `<path_to_your_Python_version> main.py`  
    [x] Or open `main.py` with your favorite IDE to execute it

3. Refine `param.py`

    [x] Adapt the `zooms` and `origin` parameters based on textual, visual, and backup feedback  
    [x] Change any other relevant parameters (see **Advanced parameters** section for wise choices)

4. Reexecute `main.py` on a sub-list of paths to .fits files (or to folders full of .fits files) to be processed

    [x] Same as 2.

5. Clean `param.py`

    [x] If the returns are still not satisfactory, go back to step 3  
    [x] Else, put `print_verbose` and `show_verbose` to `0` to speed up processing

6. Reexecute `main.py` on the full-list of paths to .fits files (or to folders full of .fits files) to be processed

    [x] Same as 2. and 4.  
    [x] Open `output_path`  
    [x] Enjoy your post-processing ðŸ˜Ž
